With EVERY court case SOMEONE WILL LOSE!! Whereupon somebody is gonna cry foul. Many will just cry--especially the children.Real divorce ""smarts"" = ""don't start a fight."" As Danny DiVito told Hubby in ""War of the Roses; ""There is no winning... there's just degrees of losing.""Law is not like Wal-Mart. Nordstom's provides a different product and a different service than Walmart. So too with lawyers. Cheap or free is NOT the same as full freight --with real dedication and expertise. BUT-- you can get a customized, tailored amount of work. It is called ""limited scope representation"".But if any lawyer tells you ONLY what you want to hear... beware. And if I tell you something you didn't want to hear? Guess what? It is because IT IS TRUE! I am not on Avvo trolling for clients. I am just the (no longer quite ""lone"") voice telling it like it is.

(Carroll, not Edna.)Nowadays, expert lawyers will do the chunk of work you need done-- for a REASONABLE cost. I do that. But----WARNING!! I personally will not work with whiners. Just saying...Choose your poison, my friends! But choose carefully. And no, I do not offer free telephone consults.

I'm looking to be of service, to people who are willing to listen. (And I can pick up your attitude by how you post. So sue me.) But guess what? if something is your ""fault"" then you CAN change it.

I went to Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio where I majored in English Literature and in History. I served two years in the Peace Corps in Turkey, teaching English as a second language, first in Fatsa on the Black Sea coast and then in Erzurum in the eastern mountains. I still remember how to speak some Turkish. I obtained a Master's degree in Public Administration from UNC in Chapel Hill and worked for the US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in Chicago and Columbus. I was Community Development Director for the City of Miamisburg, Ohio before entering law school at Ohio State. I graduated with a J.D. in 1979, took the bar exam, got married to Roberta Longfellow, honeymooned in France, and began practicing law. Roberta and I have two children, Jessica, also a returned Peace Corps volunteer (Moldova) and lawyer, and Christian, a visual, graphic, and ceramic artist. Roberta and I love reading, cooking, traveling and ballroom dancing.
